# Fresh project

Losely copied from https://github.com/albedosehen/template-deno-phresh

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task buildphaser
```

then

```
deno task start
```

Cant figure out how to stop iit from looping if buildPhaser() is uncommented in `dev.ts`
